In modern libraries, the process of locating books can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially in large collections. To address this challenge, the Book Detection System is designed as a cost-effective and user-friendly solution that aids users in quickly identifying and locating books within a library. This project combines fundamental digital logic components to create a functional and interactive system that simplifies book management.

The system uses toggle switches to Input a bookâ€™s unique identifier. This input is processed through a demultiplexer (DEMUX) to direct signals to specific outputs. Comparators are employed to ensure the input matches pre-stored book identifiers. Logical operations are carried out using basic logic gates like AND, OR, and NOT to achieve the desired functionality. For visual assistance, LEDs are used to indicate the exact location of the selected book, lighting up the corresponding section or shelf in real-time.

This project demonstrates the practical application of digital circuits in solving everyday problems and provides an efficient tool for libraries to enhance their user services. By integrating simplicity and functionality, the Book Detection System offers an innovative approach to improving library operations.
